Hello, please convert the attached answer key image into a CSV format with the following strict rules:

The very first line must be the Topic Name only.
The second line must be the exact header: Question,Answer
All subsequent lines must be the question number, a comma, and the single lowercase answer letter (a, b, c, or d).
There should be no empty lines in the file.
Here is a perfect example of the final format:
